# CloudStack CMK

1. Download the latest binary (replace version if a newer one exists)
   - wget https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey/releases/download/6.4.0/cmk.linux.x86-64

2. Make it executable
   - chmod +x cmk.linux.x86-64

3. Move it to your local bin so you can just type 'cmk'
   - sudo mv cmk.linux.x86-64 /usr/local/bin/cmk

4. Verify installation
   - cmk version
   - ````plaintext

## Configuring CMK with these Keys

### How to Generate API and Secret Keys

`If you are logged in and don't see the keys, it usually means they haven't been "generated" for your user account yet.`

- `Navigate to Accounts:` On the left-hand sidebar menu, click on Accounts.

- `Select your Account:` Click on the name of the account you are currently logged into (often it matches your username).

- `View Users:` Within the account detail page, look for a tab or a button labeled `View Users.`
  - Note: In newer versions, there is often a Users tab directly at the top of the Account details screen.

- `Select your User:` Click on your specific username from the list.

- `Generate Keys:` \* Look at the top right for a "Generate Keys" icon (it usually looks like a small key or a circular refresh arrow).
  - If the keys are already there but hidden, look for a clipboard icon or an eye icon to reveal them.

  - Caution: If you click "Generate Keys" and you already had keys configured elsewhere (like in a script), the old ones will stop working immediately.
